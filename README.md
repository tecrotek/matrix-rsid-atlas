## ⚡ Definition: The Executable Ledger

**Atlas of Gaps** is a dynamic topology of verified market inefficiencies ("Gaps") bridged via **Hybrid Chain Units (HCU)**.

This is not a library of system prompts. This is a **Registry of Executable Cognitive Cores**. Unlike static code, an HCU is a "live" algorithm (System_Prompt_Payload) that transforms an LLM/agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini) into a highly specialized Senior+ level engineer.

**Core Value Proposition:**
1.  **High-Frequency Arbitrage:** Instant elimination of friction in processes (R&D, DevOps, Business).
2.  **Zero-CapEx:** Implementation requires no servers, installations, or budget. Simply `Ctrl+C` (copy) -> `Ctrl+V` (paste).
3.  **Standardization:** A unified interaction protocol between Human and AI (Matrix RSID Protocol).

## 🧠 Philosophy: Prompt-as-Software

We believe that: **The System Prompt is the new Binary Executable.**
Traditional software (`.py`, `.js`) carries high friction: dependencies, environments, and compilation bugs. HCU operates on the physics of natural language:

*   **Zero Friction:** Time from "Download" to "Result" is < minutes/seconds.
*   **Version Controlled:** Logic is versioned as strictly as the kernel code of modern operating systems.
*   **Model Agnostic:** Adapted for SOTA models (Context Window > 128k+).

## 🌐 GHN Topology (HCU Registry)

The repository is structured into 5 functional nodes of the Global Hybrid Network (GHN). Tools are selected based on the physics of the task:

```text
/HCU_Registry
├── /CORTEX (Logic Layer) ....... [Science, Math, Deep Reasoning]
├── /GRID   (Infra Layer) ....... [API, DevOps, Code Generation]
├── /NEXUS  (Velocity Layer) .... [MVP, Marketing, Traffic]
├── /CORE   (Resource Layer) .... [Business, Management, Finance]
└── /PRIME  (Control Layer) ..... [Strategy, Ethics, Governance]
```

| **[`/CORTEX`](/HCU_Registry/CORTEX)** | **R&D / Logic** | Paper-to-Code, Data Analysis, Complex Logic. | [`HCU-CTX-..`](/HCU_Registry/CORTEX) |
| **[`/GRID`](/HCU_Registry/GRID)** | **Infrastructure** | API Wrappers, Docker, JSON Parsing. | [`HCU-GRID-..`] |
| **[`/NEXUS`](/HCU_Registry/NEXUS)** | **Velocity** | Viral Content, MVP Launch, Sales. | [`HCU-NEXUS-..`] |

## 🚀 How to Use (Protocol)

1.  **Navigate:** Open the `/HCU_Registry` folder and select the required `.json` file.
2.  **Extract:** Copy the contents of the `"system_prompt_payload"` field.
3.  **Inject:** Paste the text into the beginning of the chat or the System Instructions of your LLM/Agent (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT).
4.  **Execute:** Provide the "raw" input signal (PDF, Task, Data).
5.  **Profit:** Receive an engineering-grade result.

## 🛡️ Security & Validation (VIS Protocol)

Every HCU has been audited according to the **Matrix RSID VIS-HASE** standard:

*   ✅ **No Hallucination:** Built-in `Self-Correction` and `Sanity Check` mechanisms.
*   ✅ **Safety First:** Blocking of malicious vectors and injections.
*   ✅ **Physics-Verified:** Logic verified against real-world cases (Simulation Logs).

> *We do not publish "raw" system prompts. We publish verified engineering solutions.*

## 🤝 Contribution

We accept Pull Requests to expand the Atlas. HCU requirements:
1.  **Format:** Strict JSON (see the `HCU_TEMPLATE.json` template).
2.  **Validation:** A successful execution log (Evidence) is mandatory.
3.  **No Fluff:** No lyricism. Only algorithmic instructions.

## ⚠️ Engineering Disclaimer

Tools are provided "AS IS".

Created using the **MTX-RSID-OS** artificial intelligence system, based on modern LLM models.

The stochastic nature of the models means that the output is not 100% deterministic. The authors are not responsible for the results of LLM generation. **The operator must verify critical data before production implementation.** In the context of AI, this is critical, as models are probabilistic and may produce an error even with an ideal System Prompt.
