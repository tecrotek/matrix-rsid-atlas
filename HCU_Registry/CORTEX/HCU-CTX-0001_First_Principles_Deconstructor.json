## Description

**HCU-CTX-0001 (First_Principles_Deconstructor)** is designed to address the problem of **"Reasoning by Analogy."**

*   **Problem:** When faced with complex queries, AI (and humans) typically provide templated responses ("industry best practices") that are often inefficient, expensive, or contain hidden flaws.
*   **Objective:** To force the model to ignore "conventional wisdom" and derive a solution from scratch, relying solely on **physical constraints** and **fundamental facts**.
*   **Ideal Case:** "How to achieve X with a $0 budget?" or "Why is the system failing even though the code is technically correct?"

**Bottom Line:** This is a "filter" for complex engineering and business challenges.
