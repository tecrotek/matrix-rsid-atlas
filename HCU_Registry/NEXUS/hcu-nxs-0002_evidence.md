# Description

**HCU-NXS-0002 FRICTION (Physics of the Process):**
**Integration Latency.** The loss of kinetic energy occurring when a system (Human or AI) interrupts execution (Runtime) for manual search, validation, and the import of an external dependency. These are "thermal losses" resulting from context switching.

**PROBLEM SOLVED:**
**Digital Asset Supply Chain Disruption ("Stop-and-Fetch").**
1. **Diagnostics:** Intercepts real-time signals of `GAP` (missing tool), `ERR` (execution error), or `TOIL` (routine tasks).
2. **Solution:** Atomic provisioning. Instead of searching for a solution, the engine *synthesizes* and *embeds* the required artifact (code, configuration, dataset) directly into the execution flow.
3. **Outcome:** Transforms the blocking issue of resource absence into a non-blocking exchange transaction.
